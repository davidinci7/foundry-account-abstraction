## What is Account Abstraction?

EoAs are now smart contracts. That's all account abstraction is.

But what does that mean?

Right now, every single transaction in web3 stems from a single private key. 

> account abstraction means that not only the execution of a transaction can be arbitrarily complex computation logic as specified by the EVM, but also the authorization logic.
